Connection Manager is a utility that enables you to make in-page HTTP requests through a simplified interface to the XMLHttpRequest object. XMLHttpRequest is the mechanism commonly referred to as "Ajax," allowing your scripts to communicate with the server without a page reload, persisting the user interface across many client-server interactions. Connection Manager handles cross-browser instantiation of XMLHttpRequest, negotiates the server response and uses a callback pattern to process the response data.
